        <p>History (from Ancient Greek: ἱστορία, romanized: historíā, lit. 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by
            investigation')[2] is the study and the documentation of the past.[3][4] Events before the invention of
            writing systems are considered prehistory. "History" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as
            the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events.
            Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art
            and material artifacts, and ecological markers.[5]

            History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past
            events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.[6][7] Historians often debate which narrative
            best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate
            the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of
            the present.[6][8][9][10]

            Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding
            King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends.[11][12] History differs from myth in
            that it is supported by verifiable evidence. However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant
            interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today.
            The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of
            certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is often taught as a part of
            primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university
            studies.</p>

        <h2>PREHISTORY</h2>
        <img src="/Images/pcW.jpg" alt="pic" width="400" height="400">
        <p>In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to
            glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A
            major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social
            science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of
            history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included Fernand Braudel, E. H.
            Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich
            Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien Febvre, and Lawrence Stone. Many of the advocates of history as a
            social science were or are noted for their multidisciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with
            geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with
            psychology, Trigger history with archeology, while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre, and Le Roy Ladurie
            have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and
            economics. Nevertheless, these multidisciplinary approaches failed to produce a theory of history. So far
            only one theory of history came from the pen of a professional Historian.[46] Whatever other theories of
            history we have, they were written by experts from other fields (for example, Marxian theory of history).
            More recently, the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose
            new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

            In sincere opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper,
            John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Gerhard Ritter argued that the key to the
            historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended that history should be understood as
            an art. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data
            to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history (cf.
            histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte and George Mosse
            have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights
            era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups. Another genre of social
            history to emerge in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as
            Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary
            people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi period.

            Marxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton, Georges Lefebvre, Eugene Genovese,
            Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason, Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer, and Christopher Hill have
            sought to validate Karl Marx's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the
            Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as François Furet, Richard Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland
            Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner, and Robert Conquest have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history.
            Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela
            Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the
            experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for
            the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In
            his 1997 book In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans defended the worth of history. Another defense of
            history from postmodernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The
            Killing of History.

            Today, most historians begin their research process in the archives, on either a physical or digital
            platform. They often propose an argument and use their research to support it. John H. Arnold proposed that
            history is an argument, which creates the possibility of creating change.[5] Digital information companies,
            such as Google, have sparked controversy over the role of internet censorship in information access.[47]

            Marxian theory
            Main article: Marx's theory of history
            The Marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the
            material conditions at any given time – in other words, the relationships which people have with each other
            in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.[48]
            Overall, Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these
            material conditions in Western Europe.[49] Marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union,
            but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of
            scholarship.[50]</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of
            history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor Charles
            Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce
            superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defense
            of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators,
            prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the
            debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools,
            such as Manchester University, where Thomas Frederick Tout was professionalizing the History undergraduate
            programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.[87][88]

            In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large
            number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century
            was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track
            faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of
            the classroom teaching.[89]</p>

    <section id="Bias">
        <h2>Bias</h2>
        <p>In several countries’ history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the
            official narrative about national enemies.[92]

            In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the
            national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has
            been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have
            complained.[93] It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist
            historiography.[94][95]

            In the United States, textbooks published by the same company often differ in content from state to
            state.[96] An example of content that is represented different in different regions of the country is the
            history of the Southern states, where slavery and the American Civil War are treated as controversial
            topics. McGraw-Hill Education for example, was criticized for describing Africans brought to American
            plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.[97]

            Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with
            success.[98][99]

            In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by
            superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects
            "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented
            towards human rights, democracy and peace." The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national
            pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress,
            human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."[100]</p>
